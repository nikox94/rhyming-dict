# Rhyming dictionary for Bulgarian

Deployed at: http://dict.yurukov.org/

A very simple rhyming dictionary for the Bulgarian language. For now provides a sleek interface and an easy search. Expected developments: better rhyming matches.

This is a toy project for me to test different software development tools.
